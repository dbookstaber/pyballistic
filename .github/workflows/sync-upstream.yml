            chore(sync): apply upstream changes with pyballistic transforms
          title: 'Sync from upstream with transformations'
          body: |
            This PR was created automatically by the Sync Upstream workflow.

            - Pulls latest from upstream and applies configured transformations
            - Preserves files listed in `sync_config.json` under `exclude_paths`
            - See script at `scripts/sync_upstream.py` for details

            If there are unexpected changes, adjust `sync_config.json` or update the script.
