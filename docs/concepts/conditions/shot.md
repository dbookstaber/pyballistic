# Shot

The scene configuration for a calculation: weapon, ammo, atmosphere, winds, and angles.

- `look_angle` (a.k.a. slant angle): sight line elevation vs horizon.
- `relative_angle`: adjustment added to the weaponâ€™s `zero_elevation`.
- `cant_angle`: rotates barrel elevation into an azimuth component.
- Derived: `barrel_elevation` and `barrel_azimuth`.
